# PacMen Exercise

## Description
This project involves creating multiple PacMen that bounce around the screen. Each PacMan is created at a random position with a random velocity, and they change direction when they hit the edges of the screen.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/LucaBrizuela/PacmenExercise.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Roadmap
- Add different shapes and colors for PacMen.
- Implement collision detection between PacMen.
